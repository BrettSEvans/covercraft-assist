      <H2 id="information-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</H2>

      <H3>1.1 Account and identity data</H3>
      <P>When you register, we collect:</P>
      <UL>
        <li><strong>Email address</strong> — used for authentication and service communications.</li>
        <li><strong>Display name and avatar URL</strong> — populated from OAuth metadata if you sign in via a third-party provider (e.g. Google); otherwise you can set these manually.</li>
        <li><strong>First name and last name</strong> — optional; provided on your Profile page to personalise generated documents.</li>
      </UL>

      <H3>1.2 Career and profile data</H3>
      <P>You voluntarily provide this to enable AI generation:</P>
      <UL>
        <li><strong>Resume text</strong> — the full text of your current CV/résumé, pasted or extracted from a PDF you upload.</li>
        <li><strong>Master cover letter</strong> — an optional reusable template you write.</li>
        <li><strong>Years of experience, key skills, target industries, preferred writing tone</strong> — selections made on your Profile page.</li>
      </UL>

      <H3>1.3 Job application data</H3>
      <P>For each application you create:</P>
      <UL>
        <li><strong>Job posting URL</strong> — the URL you supply; we scrape the content via a third-party service (Firecrawl) on your behalf.</li>
        <li><strong>Job description text</strong> — extracted from the URL or pasted directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Company name, company URL, job title</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Company branding and research data</strong> — retrieved from the company website via Firecrawl and structured by AI: competitors, customers, products, and visual branding elements.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-generated documents</strong> — tailored résumés (HTML), cover letters, executive dashboards, roadmaps, RAID logs, architecture diagrams, executive reports, and other generated materials, stored with full revision history so you can view and restore previous versions.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat history</strong> — conversation turns between you and the AI assistant within an application.</li>
        <li><strong>Pipeline status</strong> — the stage of the hiring process you assign to each application.</li>
      </UL>

      <H3>1.4 Usage and operational data</H3>
      <UL>
        <li><strong>Generation usage records</strong> — a timestamped count of AI generation requests per user, used solely to enforce per-user rate limits (currently 30 scrapes per hour).</li>
        <li><strong>Asset download signals</strong> — when you download a generated document we record the asset type, job title, industry, and a hash of the HTML content. No personally identifying information is recorded; this data is used in aggregate to improve AI output quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Last sign-in timestamp</strong> — recorded in your profile to support inactivity logout behaviour.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription tier and status</strong> — your current plan (free at launch) and its status.</li>
      </UL>

      <H3>1.5 Marketing attribution data (UTM)</H3>
      <P>
        If you arrive at the sign-up page via a URL containing UTM parameters (e.g. from an advertisement or affiliate link),
        we record <code className="font-mono text-xs bg-muted px-1 rounded">utm_campaign</code>,{" "}
        <code className="font-mono text-xs bg-muted px-1 rounded">utm_source</code>, and{" "}
        <code className="font-mono text-xs bg-muted px-1 rounded">utm_medium</code> in your profile at the point of account creation.
        These values help us understand which marketing channels are effective. They are not shared with advertisers or ad networks.
      </P>

      <H3>1.6 Technical session data</H3>
      <P>
        Authentication is handled by Supabase Auth, which issues a JWT (JSON Web Token) stored in your browser's local storage by the Supabase client SDK.
        This token is used to authenticate every API request. Supabase may retain authentication event logs (sign-in, sign-out, token refresh)
        for security and fraud-prevention purposes; see Supabase's own privacy policy for details.
      </P>

      <H3>1.7 Data we do NOT collect</H3>
      <UL>
        <li>We do not run any web analytics (no Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Segment, or equivalent).</li>
        <li>We do not collect IP addresses directly; IP addresses may appear in Supabase server logs as part of infrastructure logging.</li>
        <li>We do not use browser fingerprinting.</li>
        <li>We do not collect payment card data; ResuVibe is currently free and has no payment flow.</li>

        <li><strong>Privileged operations isolated to edge functions</strong> — account deletion, data purges, and any operation requiring the service-role key execute exclusively in server-side Supabase Edge Functions. The service-role key is never exposed to the browser.</li>
        <li><strong>CORS restriction</strong> — edge functions only accept requests from the production domain, localhost development ports, and authorised Lovable preview domains.</li>

        <li><strong>AI output sanitisation</strong> — all AI-generated HTML is sanitised with DOMPurify before storage or DOM rendering to prevent cross-site scripting.</li>

      <H3>Rights under GDPR (EU / EEA / UK)</H3>
      <P>If you are located in the EU, EEA, or UK you have the following rights under the GDPR:</P>
      <UL>
        <li>
          <strong>Right of access (Art. 15)</strong> — request a copy of the personal data we hold about you and information about how we process it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to rectification (Art. 16)</strong> — correct inaccurate or incomplete personal data. Most profile data can be corrected directly in the app on the Profile page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to erasure (Art. 17)</strong> — request deletion of your personal data. You can exercise this right immediately and completely by using the Delete Account function in Profile → Danger Zone, or by emailing us.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18)</strong> — request that we restrict processing of your data in certain circumstances (e.g. while a rectification request is assessed).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to data portability (Art. 20)</strong> — receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format and transmit it to another controller. Email us to request a JSON export of your profile and application data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to object (Art. 21)</strong> — object to processing based on legitimate interests. We will cease such processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override your interests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rights related to automated decision-making (Art. 22)</strong> — AI-generated documents are produced by automated processes, but these outputs affect only the career materials we create for you and do not produce legal or similarly significant effects. You retain full control: you can edit, discard, or regenerate any output at any time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong> — where processing is based on consent (advertising), you may withdraw consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of prior processing (see Section 6.3).
        </li>
      </UL>
